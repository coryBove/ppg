better things, we believe we will be forgiven and will have learned our
lesson. If we are not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others,

<p><em>To sum up about sex: We earnestly pray for the right ideal, for
guidance in each questionable situation, for sanity, and for the
strength to do the right thing. If sex is very troublesome, we throw
ourselves the harder into helping others. We think of their needs and
work for them. This takes us out of ourselves. It quiets the imperious
urge, when to yield would mean heartache</em></p>

<p>Long Form:<br />
<em>Problems of money, property, and authority may easily divert us from
our primary spiritual aim. We think, therefore, that any considerable
property of genuine use to A.A. should be separately incorporated and
managed, thus dividing the material from the spiritual. An A.A. group,
as such, should never go into business. Secondary aids to A.A., such as
clubs or hospitals which require much property or administration, ought
to be incorporated and so set apart that, if necessary, they can be
freely discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought not to use
the A.A. name. Their management should be the sole responsibility of
those people who financially support them. For clubs, A.A. managers are
usually preferred. But hospitals, as well as other places of
recuperation, ought to be well outside A.A.—and medically supervised.
While an A.A. group may cooperate with anyone, such cooperation ought
never go so far as affiliation or endorsement, actual or implied. An
A.A. group can bind itself to no one.</em></p>

<em>The A.A. groups themselves ought to be fully supported by the

should soon achieve this ideal; that any public solicitation of funds
using the name of Alcoholics Anonymous is highly dangerous, whether by
groups, clubs, hospitals, or other outside agencies; that acceptance of
large gifts from any source, or of contributions carrying any obligation
whatever, is unwise. Then too, we view with much concern those A.A.
treasuries which continue, beyond prudent reserves, to accumulate funds
for no stated A.A. purpose. Experience has often warned us that nothing

<p><em>Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the
A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</em></p>
<p>Long Form:<br />
<em>No A.A. group or member should ever, in such a way as to implicate
A.A., express any opinion on outside controversial issues—particularly
those of politics, alcohol reform, or sectarian religion. The Alcoholics
Anonymous groups oppose no one. Concerning such matters they can express
no views whatever.</em></p>

<p>When we retire at night we constructively review our day. Were
we:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Resentful</li>
<li>Selfish</li>
<li>Dishonest</li>
<li>Afraid</li>
<li>Do we owe an apology?</li>
<li>Have we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with
another person at once?</li>
<li>Were we kind and loving toward all?</li>
<li>What could we have done better?</li>
<li>Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time?</li>
<li>Or were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could
pack into the stream of life?</li>
<li>We must be careful not to drift into worry, remorse or morbid
reflection, for that would diminish our usefulness to others.</li>
<li>After making our review we ask God’s forgiveness and inquire what
corrective measures we should take.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>On awakening, let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We
consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct
our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity,
dishonest or self-seeking motives.</em></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be
able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration,
an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don’t
struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we
have tried this for a while.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous, pg. 86</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that
we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that we be
given whatever we need to take care of such problems. We ask especially
for freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for
ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be
helped. We are careful never to pray for our own selfish ends. Many of
us have wasted a lot of time doing that and it doesn’t work. You can
easily see why.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous, pg. 87</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and
ask for the right thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves we
are no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times
each day “Thy will be done.” We are then in much less danger of
excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions. We
become much more efficient. We do not tire so easily, for we are not
burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange
life to suit ourselves.</em></p>
